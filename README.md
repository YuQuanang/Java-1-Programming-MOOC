# Java-1-Programming-MOOC-
University of Helsinkiâ€™s free massive open online course (MOOC) on programming! This is an updated version of our popular course Object-Oriented Programming with Java.

My Codings for each part were done by myself. It contains 7 parts making up this whole Java course. 

Feel free to take reference.
The repository is meant for my own self-tracking of my coding journey.
